The truth is there are a lot of different, legitimate ways to make money.

It was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him.',6,75),(20,6,'On Saturday nights I would sit by the phone','in the lobby, waiting for Naoko to call.

But even that favor is questionable,',2,121),(27,8,'He thought of the cost exacted','He thought of the cost exacted, year after year, by the soil; and it remained as it had been—a little more barren, perhaps, a little more frugal of increase. Nothing had changed. Their lives had been expended in cheerless labor, their wills broken, their intelligences numbed.',3,133),(28,9,'His mother had always taught him','His mother had always taught him not to ever think of himself as better than others.

Soon everything seemed dull: another sunrise, the lives of heroes, failing love, war, the discoveries people made about each other.',6,143),(33,10,'Pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field.','Pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field. Cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side. What looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy.

In fact, it was difficult for anyone to come up with a date they had first appeared. It had seemed they\'d always been there and yet they seemed so out of place. Why nobody had removed them was a question that had been asked time and again, but while they all thought it, nobody had ever found the energy to actually do it.',2,47),(35,12,'All he wanted was a candy bar.','All he wanted was a candy bar.

It might have had something to do with the gun pointed at his face.',1,4),(36,12,'This is important to remember.','This is important to remember. Love isn\'t like pie.

The red line continued relentlessly across the page and the room would never be the same.',9,45),(38,13,'He was an expert but not in a discipline','He was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate. He knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server ice-cream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time. It had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it.',2,2),(39,13,'His parents continued to question him.','He didn\'t know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth. He explained again and again, and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination. There was no way that grandpa, who had been dead for five years, could have told him where the treasure had been hidden.

This was the best take he had done so far','He stepped away from the mic. This was the best take he had done so far, but something seemed missing. Then it struck him all at once. Visuals ran in front of his eyes and music rang in his ears. His eager fingers went to work in an attempt to capture his thoughts hoping the results would produce something that was at least half their glory.',8,84),(50,15,'Were you in love with her?','The question is in a way meaningless, she knows, but one must ask.

It never seemed to end. Even if he cleaned the entire beach, more plastic would cover it the next day after the tide had come in. Although it was a futile effort that would never be done, he continued to pick up the trash each day.',5,38),(58,19,'All Hallows Day: grief comes in waves.','t threatens to capsize him.

The striking thing about the normal is that there is nothing normal about it:',8,124),(60,20,'Have you ever wondered about toes?','Why 10 toes and not 12. Why are some bigger than others? Some people can use their toes to pick up things while others can barely move them on command. Some toes are nice to look at while others are definitely not something you want to look at. Toes can be stubbed and make us scream. Toes help us balance and walk. 10 toes are just something to ponder.',3,40),(61,20,'In truth, Mrs. Gradgrind’s stock of facts in','general was woefully defective; but Mr. Gradgrind in raising her to her high matrimonial position, had been influenced by two reasons.  Firstly, she was most satisfactory as a question of figures; and, secondly,',9,91),(62,20,'Act, implores the Ghost of Future Regret.','Jacob hurries past the tomatoes and catches her up near the gate.‘Miss Abigawa?

I can\'t handle this anymore. She fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter. This is much more than I ever signed up to do.',6,61),(64,21,'It was difficult to explain to them','It was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life. While everyone around him was in tears and upset, he actually felt more at ease. The doctor said it would be less than a year. That gave him a year to live, something he\'d failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then.',2,73),(65,22,'He had three simple rules by which he lived.','He had three simple rules by which he lived. The first was to never eat blue food. There was nothing in nature that was edible that was blue. People often asked about blueberries, but everyone knows those are actually purple. He understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by, but it had served him well thus far in the 50+ years of his life.',2,28),(66,22,'There was something in the tree.','There was something in the tree. It was difficult to tell from the ground, but Rachael could see movement. She squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement, trying to decipher exactly what she had spied.',4,81),(67,23,'Sometimes… Come on, how often exactly,','Bert?

Sometimes (I have nothing to say in reply to your question), while Lolita would be haphazardly preparing her homework,',1,106),(68,24,'He ran as he’d never run before','hope nor despair. He ran because the world was divided into opposites and his side had already been chosen for him, his only choice being whether or not to play his part with heart and courage.',8,108),(69,24,'It was but a hurried parting in a common','street, yet it was a sacred remembrance to these two common people.  Utilitarian economists, skeletons of schoolmasters, Commissioners of Fact,',4,119),(70,25,'It wasn\'t quite yet time to panic.','It wasn\'t quite yet time to panic. There was still time to salvage the situation. At least that is what she was telling himself. The reality was that it was time to panic and there wasn\'t time to salvage the situation, but he continued to delude himself into believing there was.',5,11),(71,25,'It seemed like it should have been so simple.','It seemed like it should have been so simple. There was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done. It was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time, but that wasn\'t the case. The deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished.',5,57),(72,25,'But they didn’t devote the whole evening to','music. After a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself. Stop. There was first a game at blind-man’s buff.',2,103),(73,26,'She was aware that things could go wrong.','She was aware that things could go wrong. In fact, she had trained her entire life in anticipation that things would go wrong one day. She had quiet confidence as she started to see that this was the day that all her training would be worthwhile and useful. At this point, she had no idea just how wrong everything would go that day.',7,12),(74,27,'It went through such rapid contortions','It went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness, and could not, for the life of him, tell whether he held the sheep right side up, or upside down. But that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself, who, with a sudden twist, jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust.',3,25),(75,27,'She patiently waited for his number to be called.','She patiently waited for his number to be called. She had no desire to be there, but her mom had insisted that she go. She\'s resisted at first, but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go. Mom tended to be that way. She would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted. So, here she sat, patiently waiting for her number to be called.',7,26),(76,27,'The red glint of paint sparkled under the sun.','He had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten, and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago. It was his baby and he spent hours caring for it, pampering it, and fondling over it. She knew this all too well, and that\'s exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it.',0,87),(77,27,'The embassy’s door was of bulletproof steel','lined with a veneer of English oak. You attained it by touching a button in a silent lift. The royal crest, in this air-conditioned stillness, suggested silicone and funeral parlours.',7,110),(78,27,'He let the phone slip from his hand and lay','crying for a while, silently, shaking the cheap bed. He didn’t know what to do, he didn’t know how to live. Each new thing he encountered in life impelled him in a direction that fully convinced him of its rightness,',6,113),(79,28,'She had a terrible habit o comparing her life to others','She had a terrible habit o comparing her life to others. She realized that their life experiences were completely different than her own and that she saw only what they wanted her to see, but that didn\'t matter. She still compared herself and yearned for what she thought they had and she didn\'t.',3,18),(80,28,'The house was located at the top of the hill','The house was located at the top of the hill at the end of a winding road. It wasn\'t obvious that the house was there, but everyone in town knew that it existed. They were just all too afraid to ever go and see it in person.',9,56),(81,29,'She looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through.','She looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through. \"You need to learn to think for yourself,\" she wanted to tell him. \"Your friends are holding you back and bringing you down.\" But she didn\'t because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery, he would never give them up.',4,59),(82,30,'She has seen this scene before.','She has seen this scene before. It had come to her in dreams many times before. She had to pinch herself to make sure it wasn\'t a dream again. As her fingers squeezed against her arm, she felt the pain. It was this pain that immediately woke her up.',6,22),(83,30,'Debbie had taken George for granted','Debbie had taken George for granted for more than fifteen years now. He wasn\'t sure what exactly had made him choose this time and place to address the issue, but he decided that now was the time. He looked straight into her eyes and just as she was about to speak, turned away and walked out the door.',5,34),(84,30,'Debbie knew she was being selfish','Debbie knew she was being selfish and unreasonable. She understood why the others in the room were angry and frustrated with her and the way she was acting. In her eyes, it didn\'t really matter how they felt because she simply didn\'t care.',5,54),(85,30,'He couldn\'t move. His head throbbed and spun.','He couldn\'t move. His head throbbed and spun.
